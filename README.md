**01. Image to Pencil Sketch**

- **Library Installation**: The page starts with installing the opencv-python library and confirming its installation along with the numpy library.

- **Image Processing Steps**: It outlines the steps to convert an image to a pencil sketch using OpenCV, including reading the image, converting it to grayscale, inverting the image, applying Gaussian blur, and finally creating the pencil sketch by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurred image.

- **Image Display**: The code uses cv2_imshow to display the original, grayscale, inverted, blurred, and final pencil sketch images.
